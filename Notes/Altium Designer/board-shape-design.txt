=> The first thing to do is to set the origin:
    > Edit > Origin > Set:
        --> Set the origin manually
        or
        --> Click J, click L and type a specific point coordinates

=> It's recommended to choose the Board Planning Mode while setting the board shape:
    > Design > Edit Board Shape > [drag the X and Y axes]
        --> While dragging, pay attention to your board dimensions at the left lower corner

=> Another way is to add objects and define the board shape from the selected ones.

=> The third way is to import a dxf file and define the board shape from the selected objects.

=> The fourth way is:
    > Select 2D Layout Mode
    > Select Mechanical Layer
    > Place lines and arcs
    > Define the board shape

=> To add a cutout to your PCB:
    > Select the 2D Layout Mode
    > Design > Board Shape > Design Board Cutout
