## KiCad Templates for New Projects

Provides a number of additional board and production house templates for **KiCad EDA**.

The templates here serve two purposes:

1. They provide the outline, standard position and shared components for common adapters.

2. They setup basic board parameters such as DRC limits and preferred track widths.
